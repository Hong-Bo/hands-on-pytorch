# hands-on-pytorch

This tutorial is composed of several examples about 
deep learning. It is expected that these examples will
endow you with the basics of deep learning and PyTorch.


1. Directory ./simplenet trains a simple neural network
   using MNIST data.

2. Directory ./cnn trains a two-layered convolutional
   network using MNIST data
