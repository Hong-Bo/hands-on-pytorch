# Hands On Pytorch

This tutorial is composed of several examples about 
deep learning. It is expected that these examples will
endow a beginner with the basics of both deep learning and PyTorch.

## Contents

Several independent projects are included in this tutorial. 
According to the order of from simple to complex, these projects are

1. Training a very simple neural network to classify MNIST data (./nn)

2. Directory ./cnn trains a two-layered convolutional
   network using MNIST data

3. Directory ./resnet trains a multi-layered ResNet using
   CIFAR-10 data
